The purpose of this project was to create a video game using Processing 3 IDE. The game itself is a copy of Streets of Rage 2 level 1 and we tried to recreate it using Processing 3.

Features
-----
- 2D Side Scrolling Beat 'em up
- 16-bit style art
- 1 Level with a Final Boss at the end
- Sound FX & Music

Installation
---
To play this game, one needs to have Processing 3 IDE installed. Once that is done, open any of the .pde files in the Boundaries folder. Next, install ptmx and minim library as they are required. This is done in Processing 3 IDE by going to Sketch->Import Library->Add Library->ptmx and Sketch->Import Library->Add Library->minim. Once that is done, you can run the game. It is recommended that the game is run on 1920x1080 resolution as it does not scale well above or below that resolution. 

How to play
----
You move by pressing the arrows keys and punching by pressing "z".
